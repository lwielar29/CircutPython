# CircutPython
My circut python assignments
2019-2020

LED FADE
 
Using CircutPython I developed code to make an led light slowly get brighter and then to slowly face back until it is very dim.  

LED BLINK

Similary to LED FADE, I used CircutPython to make my led turn on and off. Although it is a simple assignment using CircutPython instead of arduino required me to learn an almost new language of code. 

SERVO
 
For this assignment I learned how to make a servo spin back and forth using CircutPython code. The servo would spin in one direction when I touched one wire and would spin in the other direction when I touched the other wire. 

LCD PRESSES

I wired and coded an LCD screen to print the number of times I pressed a button through CircutPython. I had to add a lot of new libraries to CIRCUTROPY in order to use my LCD screen. 

PHOTOINTERRUPTER

This assignment required me to wire a photointerrupter and code so that it would count how many times something had passed between the photointerrupter legs. The tricky part was then that my serial monitor had to print how many times something had passed within my photointerrupter every 4 seconds.
